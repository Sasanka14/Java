The "Pattern(Part I)" folder focuses on teaching the concept of nested loops in programming, specifically in Java, and their 
application in creating various basic patterns. Within this folder, you will find examples and exercises that demonstrate how to use 
nested loops to generate different patterns. These include:

1. **Star Patterns**:
   - Creating simple star patterns using nested loops to print rows and columns of stars.
   - Examples like square patterns, inverted star patterns, and half-pyramid star patterns.

2. **Number Patterns**:
   - Generating numeric patterns with nested loops to print sequences of numbers.
   - Examples include half-pyramids with numbers and other number-based patterns.

3. **Character Patterns**:
   - Printing patterns with alphabets using nested loops.
   - Examples include character pyramids and sequences.

Through the exercises in this folder, learners can develop a solid understanding of how nested loops function and how they can be 
applied to create various patterns. This foundational knowledge is essential for tackling more complex programming challenges that 
involve multiple layers of iteration.
