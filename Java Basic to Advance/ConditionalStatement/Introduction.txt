The folder "Conditional Statement" contains code examples and resources dedicated to understanding and implementing various 
conditional statements in programming, particularly in the context of Java. Here, you can find explanations, examples, and exercises 
that cover topics such as:

1. **If Statements**: Exploring basic conditional statements used to execute code blocks based on certain conditions.

2. **If-Else Statements**: Understanding how to provide alternative execution paths when conditions are not met.

3. **If-Elseif Statements**: Learning to handle multiple conditions using else-if statements.

4. **Switch-Case Statements**: Exploring the switch-case statement for multi-way branching based on the value of an expression.

5. **Ternary Operator**: Understanding the ternary operator as a shorthand for simple if-else statements.

Through the contents of this folder, learners can grasp the fundamentals of conditional statements, which are essential for 
controlling the flow of execution in programs and making decisions based on specific conditions. Later, these concepts can be 
applied to solve more complex problems and build robust applications.

Later, I will upload my handwritten notes to my website.
