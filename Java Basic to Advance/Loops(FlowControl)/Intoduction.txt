The "Loops(FlowControl)" folder is dedicated to helping learners understand the concept of loops in programming, particularly in Java.
It includes explanations, examples, and exercises that cover various types of loops used to control the flow of a program. Key topics 
include:

1. **For Loop**:
   - Used for iterating over a sequence of values or executing a block of code a specific number of times.
   - Examples demonstrate common use cases like printing numbers and calculating sums.

2. **While Loop**:
   - Repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
   - Exercises illustrate scenarios such as continuously prompting user input until a condition is met.

3. **Do-While Loop**:
   - Similar to the while loop but guarantees at least one execution of the code block before checking the condition.
   - Practical examples show how to use this loop for tasks requiring at least one iteration.

4. **Common Pitfalls**:
   - Highlights typical mistakes such as infinite loops, off-by-one errors, and logical errors.
   - Examples help learners recognize and avoid these pitfalls in their code.

Through the contents of this folder, learners will gain a comprehensive understanding of loop constructs, enabling them to efficiently
manage repetitive tasks and control program flow.
