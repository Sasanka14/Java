The folder "Arrays (Part II)" contains a continuation of advanced Java programs focusing on array operations and algorithms. Building 
on the foundational knowledge from "Arrays (Part I)," this collection delves into more complex problems and solutions, providing 
practical examples and implementations. Each program is designed to enhance understanding and proficiency in handling arrays through 
various algorithms and techniques. Below is an overview of the key topics and their corresponding programs included in this folder:

1. **Maximum Subarray Sum**:
   - Implementation of Kadane's Algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - Demonstrates a dynamic programming approach for efficient computation.

2. **Trapping Rainwater**:
   - Computes the amount of water that can be trapped after raining given an elevation map.
   - Uses auxiliary arrays to track the maximum heights and calculate trapped water.

3. **Stock Buy and Sell**:
   - Finds the maximum profit from a single buy and sell transaction given stock prices over days.
   - Optimized solution using linear time complexity.

4. **Contains Duplicate**:
   - Checks if any value appears at least twice in an array.
   - Utilizes hash sets for efficient duplicate detection.

5. **Rotated Sorted Array Search**:
   - Searches for a target value in a rotated sorted array.
   - Implements binary search with logarithmic time complexity.

6. **Three Sum**:
   - Finds all unique triplets in an array that sum to zero.
   - Employs sorting and the two-pointer technique to avoid duplicates and ensure efficient computation.

These programs collectively serve as a comprehensive resource for mastering advanced array operations and algorithms in Java. 
Each example is well-documented and structured to provide clear insights into solving complex array-based problems.
