The folder "Pattern II" contains a collection of Java programs designed to illustrate the creation of various geometric patterns 
using loops and conditional statements. Each file in the folder focuses on generating a specific pattern, demonstrating practical 
implementations of nested loops and logical structures in Java. Below is an outline of some key programs included in the folder and 
their purposes:

1. **Inverted & Rotated Half-Pyramid**:
   - Generates an inverted and rotated half-pyramid pattern using numbers or stars.
   - Demonstrates the use of nested loops to control spaces and stars for the desired pattern shape.

2. **Butterfly Pattern**:
   - Creates a butterfly pattern with two symmetric wings of stars.
   - Utilizes nested loops to manage spaces and stars for upper and lower parts of the butterfly.

3. **Solid Rhombus Pattern**:
   - Prints a solid rhombus shape with stars.
   - Uses loops to manage leading spaces and stars to achieve the rhombus shape.

4. **Diamond Shape Pattern**:
   - Generates a diamond pattern with stars, including gaps between stars for a clear shape.
   - Demonstrates the creation of symmetric shapes with an upper and lower part using loops.

5. **Hollow Rhombus Pattern**:
   - Creates a hollow rhombus shape with stars outlining the rhombus and spaces inside.
   - Uses conditional statements within loops to manage the placement of stars and spaces.
    
And many more................

These programs collectively serve as a comprehensive resource for learning and practicing pattern generation in Java. Each program is 
structured to provide clear insights into the logical flow and loop constructs required to create complex shapes and designs.
