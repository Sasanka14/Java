The folder "Variable and Data Types" contains code examples and resources aimed at helping learners understand the fundamental 
concepts of variables and data types in programming, particularly in the context of Java. Here, you can find explanations, examples, 
and exercises that cover topics such as:

1. Declaration and initialization of variables.
2. Different types of data that can be stored in variables (e.g., integers, floating-point numbers, characters, booleans).
3. Basic operations and manipulations performed on variables.
4. Understanding the scope and lifetime of variables.
5. Exploring various data types provided by Java, including primitive data types and reference types.
6. Learning about type conversion and type casting in Java.
7. Best practices and conventions for naming variables and choosing appropriate data types.

By exploring the contents of this folder, learners can gain a solid understanding of how variables and data types work in Java 
programming, which forms the foundation for building more complex programs and applications.
