The folder "Folder or Method" contains a collection of Java programs designed to illustrate various programming concepts and 
functionalities. Each file in the folder typically addresses a specific problem or demonstrates a particular feature of the Java 
language. Below is an outline of some key programs included in the folder and their purposes:

1. **Function Overloading**:
   - Demonstrates how to create multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (overloading).
   - Shows practical examples of overloaded methods for different data types (int, float, String) and different numbers of arguments.

2. **Prime Number Check**:
   - Contains programs to determine if a number is prime using optimized methods.
   - Includes range-based prime checking to find all prime numbers within a given range.

3. **Binary and Decimal Conversion**:
   - Illustrates methods to convert binary numbers to decimal and vice versa.
   - Demonstrates how to use loops and string manipulation for conversions.

4. **Palindrome Check**:
   - Provides methods to check if a given number or word is a palindrome.
   - Combines string reversal techniques with equality checks.

5. **Sum of Digits**:
   - Implements a method to compute the sum of digits in an integer.
   - Uses loop-based digit extraction and summation.

6. **Math Methods**:
   - Showcases the use of various Java `Math` class methods like `Math.abs`, `Math.sqrt`, `Math.pow`, etc.
   - Provides practical examples to demonstrate mathematical operations.

7. **Even Number Check**:
   - Contains a method to check if a number is even.
   - Includes a test program to verify the functionality.

8. **Scope Demonstration**:
   - Illustrates the concept of method scope and block scope in Java.
   - Explains the visibility and lifetime of variables within different scopes.

The folder serves as a valuable resource for learning and understanding fundamental and advanced Java programming concepts through 
practical code examples. Each program is commented and structured to provide clear insights into the problem-solving approaches and 
the usage of Java features.
