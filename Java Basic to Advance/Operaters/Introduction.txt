The folder "Operators" contains code examples and resources aimed at helping learners understand the various types of operators used in
programming, particularly in the context of Java. Here, you can find explanations, examples, and exercises that cover topics such as:
 
1. **Arithmetic Operators**:
   - Basic mathematical operations such as addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and modulus (`%`).
   - Example: Performing arithmetic operations on integers and floating-point numbers.

2. **Relational Operators**:
   - Comparison operations to evaluate relationships between two operands, such as equal to (`==`), not equal to (`!=`), 
     greater than (`>`), less than (`<`), greater than or equal to (`>=`), and less than or equal to (`<=`).
   - Example: Comparing two integer values to demonstrate relational operators.

3. **Logical Operators**:
   - Logical operations used to combine multiple boolean expressions, including logical AND (`&&`), logical OR (`||`), 
     and logical NOT (`!`).
   - Example: Evaluating boolean expressions and demonstrating the use of logical operators.

4. **Unary Operators**:
   - Operations that involve a single operand, such as unary plus (`+`), unary minus (`-`), increment (`++`), and decrement (`--`).
   - Example: Incrementing and decrementing integer values to show the effect of unary operators.

5. **Bitwise Operators**:
   - Operations performed on individual bits of integer types, including bitwise AND (`&`), bitwise OR (`|`), bitwise XOR (`^`), 
     bitwise NOT (`~`), and shift operators (`<<`, `>>`, `>>>`).
   - Example: Performing bitwise operations on integer values.

6. **Assignment Operators**:
   - Operators used to assign values to variables, including simple assignment (`=`) and compound assignment 
     operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`).
   - Example: Using compound assignment operators to simplify expressions.

7. **Ternary Operator**:
   - A shorthand for the if-else statement that assigns a value to a variable based on a condition. It is represented as `? :`.
   - Example: Using the ternary operator to make conditional assignments.

8. **Special Operators**:
   - Includes instance of operator to check object type and the conditional operator for short-circuit operations.

By exploring the contents of this folder, learners can gain a comprehensive understanding of how operators work in Java programming, 
which is essential for performing various operations and building logical structures in their programs.

Later, I will upload my handwritten notes to my website.
