A folder named "2D Array" likely contains various programs and concepts related to two-dimensional arrays, which are a data structure that stores elements in a grid-like fashion (rows and columns). The folder could include:

1. **Basic Operations**: Programs that demonstrate creating, initializing, and accessing elements in a 2D array.
2. **Matrix Manipulations**: Examples might include programs like:
   - **Matrix Addition**: Adding two matrices element-wise.
   - **Matrix Multiplication**: Multiplying two matrices using the matrix multiplication rules.
   - **Transpose of a Matrix**: Swapping rows and columns as demonstrated in the code you provided.
3. **Searching and Sorting**: Programs to search for specific elements (e.g., linear search, staircase search) or to sort rows and columns in a 2D array.
4. **Special Problems**: Programs solving specific problems like counting occurrences of a particular element (e.g., how many times 7 appears), summing elements in specific rows or columns, or performing operations like rotation of a matrix.
5. **Input/Output Handling**: Programs that demonstrate how to take input for 2D arrays and print them in a matrix format.

Overall, the "2D Array" folder would serve as a collection of examples and problem-solving strategies to understand and manipulate two-dimensional arrays in programming.
