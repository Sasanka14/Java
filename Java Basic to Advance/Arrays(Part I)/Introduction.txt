The folder "Arrays (Part I)" contains a series of Java programs demonstrating various operations and algorithms involving arrays. 
Each file showcases different techniques for handling arrays, providing practical examples for learning and understanding array 
manipulation in Java. Below is a summary of the key programs included in the folder and their purposes:

1. **Array Input, Output, and Update**:
   - Demonstrates how to input values into an array, output the array elements, and update a specific element in the array.
   - Uses loops for traversing and modifying the array, with user input handled by the Scanner class.

2. **Linear Search**:
   - Implements the linear search algorithm to find an element in an array.
   - Shows how to traverse the array to check each element sequentially until the desired element is found.

3. **Binary Search**:
   - Implements the binary search algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array.
   - Demonstrates the use of the divide-and-conquer approach to efficiently locate the element.

4. **Find Largest and Smallest Elements**:
   - Contains programs to find the largest and smallest elements in an array.
   - Uses simple iteration to compare elements and determine the maximum and minimum values.

5. **Array Reversal**:
   - Provides a method to reverse the elements of an array.
   - Shows how to swap elements from the start and end to achieve the reversed array.

6. **Array Pairs**:
   - Prints all unique pairs of elements from the array.
   - Demonstrates nested loops to generate and display each pair.

7. **Array Subarrays**:
   - Prints all possible subarrays of a given array and counts the total number of subarrays.
   - Uses nested loops to generate subarrays starting from each element.

These programs collectively serve as a comprehensive resource for learning basic and intermediate array operations in Java. 
Each program is well-structured and documented to provide clear insights into the implementation of various array-based algorithms 
and techniques.
